      <h2>Timeline of Bad Bunny's Life</h2>
      <div id="detail">
        <h3>March 10, 1994</h3>
        <p>Benito Antonio Martínez was born on March 10, 1994, in Almirante Sur barrio in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. His father, Tito, was a truck driver, and his mother, Lysaurie, is a retired schoolteacher. His mother often listened to salsa, merengue, and ballads, such as Juan Gabriel's "Abrázame muy fuerte" while Bad Bunny helped her with chores around the house. He has two younger brothers, Bernie and Bysael, and considers his close friends to be part of his family. He said he was raised in a happy home. As "a lanky wallflower with a booming voice", the rapper has described himself as a child by saying, “I wasn't the kid who got involved in the streets. I liked to be at home with my family.” </p>

        <h3>2016</h3>
        <p>While working as a bagger at Supermercados Econo in Vega Baja in 2016, Bad Bunny released music as an independent artist on SoundCloud, where his song "Diles" caught the attention of DJ Luian who signed him to his record label, Hear this Music. DJ Luian introduced Bad Bunny to the production team Mambo Kingz, who were intrigued by Bad Bunny's musical experimentation and style of dress. Since then, he has earned multiple top-ten entries on the US Hot Latin Songs chart. His breakthrough single, "Soy Peor", established him as a forerunner in the Latin American trap scene and reached number 22 on the Hot Latin Songs chart. Ten months after the video for "Soy Peor"'s release, it reached 330 million views on YouTube. His song "Krippy Kush" featuring Farruko also became a success, and was eventually remixed by American rapper Nicki Minaj. Bad Bunny's May 2017 collaboration with Karol G, "Ahora Me Llama", garnered more than 756 million views on YouTube and reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. The song was described by Marty Preciado of NPR as a "bass-heavy, unapologetic trap anthem to the power of femininity, soiled in hi-hats and heavy sub-bass [that] challenges hegemonic masculinity, singing about respect, love and sex-positive decisions." "Ahora Me Llama" was listed on "Alt.Latino's Favorites: The Songs Of 2017" as one of the best Latin songs of 2017. </p>

        <h3>2017</h3>
        <p>The rapper met jewelry designer Gabriela Berlingeri in 2017 at a restaurant while dining with his family, and the two began dating soon after. Berlingeri assisted Bad Bunny in recording the 2018 song "Te Guste" by providing scratch vocals for Jennifer Lopez's portions of the song. Bad Bunny kept his relationship with Berlingeri secret from the public until 2020. He explained his decision to publicly acknowledge their relationship by saying, “I am happy with her. [People] don't know she has helped me a lot in emotional aspects when I needed it the most." Berlingeri became the first Latina to shoot the cover of Rolling Stone when she photographed the rapper for the magazine's May 2020 cover. </p>

        <h3>2018</h3>
        <p>Bad Bunny says he likes to live a calm life and immediately after a concert he leaves the area to avoid crowds. He disappeared from social media for a time when he was overwhelmed with his sudden rise to fame. Views of his videos on YouTube tallied seven billion in 2018. In 2019, Bad Bunny played on the "Away" roster during the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game at the Bojangles' Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina.

          His fashion sense has been noted by the media. Vanessa Rosales of CNN opined that "in pink, florals and short shorts, Bad Bunny champions a new masculinity". According to Vogue, Bad Bunny is a "well-known sunglasses fanatic". The rapper once joked that being able to wear sunglasses at night was a key motivation for becoming an artist. His gender variant behavior is on full display in many of his videos, and when he, at award shows, appears with well-manicured and polished, long fingernails. In the video for his single "Estamos Bien", Bad Bunny is seen enjoying time with his friends, then polishing his fingernails with a purple nail polish then blows them dry. His video for "Yo Perreo Sola" featuries the artist performing in full drag. His fashion sense is also influenced by his interest in skateboarding as a teenager. After interviewing him in 2018, NPR interviewers Felix Contreras and Jasmine Garsd said that one of the things that struck them most was his humility. </p>

        <h3>November 22, 2019</h3>
        <p>YHLQMDLG debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, becoming the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the chart. The album was met with critical acclaim from critics, who praised the album's musical diversity. "Vete" was released as the lead single of the album on November 22, 2019. The album title was first mentioned during a sequence of the accompanying music video. The second single, "Ignorantes", with Panamanian singer Sech came out on February 14, 2020. In March 2020, Bad Bunny released the music video for "Yo Perreo Sola", in which the artist performs in drag. The final frame of the video denounces sexual harassment of women, and reads: ""If she doesn't want to dance with you, respect her, she twerks alone". On the song and video, Bad Bunny stated "I wrote it from the perspective of a woman. I wanted a woman's voice to sing it — 'yo perreo sola' — because it doesn't mean the same thing when a man sings it. But I do feel like that woman sometimes". "Yo Perreo Sola" landed No. 1 on the Billboard Latin Airplay chart, earning Bad Bunny his ninth No.1 on the chart in just over two years. </p>

The album's title stands for "Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana" (Spanish for "I Do What I Want") and features collaborations with Daddy Yankee, Yaviah, Jowell & Randy, and Ñengo Flow. The album is an homage to the marquesinas (garage parties) Bad Bunny grew up attending, and features many nods to early/mid-2000s reggaeton. On the final song on the album, the artist announced his intention to retire after releasing one more album with the lyric "In nine months I'll release another, to retire calmly like Miguel Cotto", referencing the retirement of the Puerto Rican boxer. He noted that the stress of fame has had a negative impact on his mental health. </p>
